Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can radically alter the genomes of
microorganisms, providing the capacity to adapt to new lifestyles,
environments, and hosts. However, the extent of HGT between
eukaryotes is unclear. Using whole-genome, gene-by-gene phylogenetic analysis we demonstrate an extensive pattern of crosskingdom HGT between fungi and oomycetes. Comparative
genomics, including the de novo genome sequence of Hyphochytrium catenoides, a free-living sister of the oomycetes, shows that
these transfers largely converge within the radiation of oomycetes
that colonize plant tissues. The repertoire of HGTs includes a large
number of putatively secreted proteins; for example, 7.6% of the
secreted proteome of the sudden oak death parasite Phytophthora ramorum has been acquired from fungi by HGT. Transfers
include gene products with the capacity to break down plant cell
walls and acquire sugars, nucleic acids, nitrogen, and phosphate
sources from the environment. Predicted HGTs also include proteins implicated in resisting plant defense mechanisms and effector proteins for attacking plant cells. These data are consistent
with the hypothesis that some oomycetes became successful plant
parasites by multiple acquisitions of genes from fungi.

H

orizontal gene transfer (HGT) involves the transfer of genetic material between reproductively isolated lineages (1,
2) and has been an important factor in prokaryotic evolution (3–
5). By contrast, the role of HGT between eukaryotic genomes is
less clear (2, 6) and seems to have occurred at a lower frequency,
with some reports suggesting that HGT between eukaryotic
kingdoms is rare (7). Conversely, HGTs originating from prokaryotic genomes constitute a signiﬁcant, but relatively small,
proportion of the total inventory of genes in phagotrophic protists (8–12) and some osmotrophic fungi (13).
Fungi branch with animals on the tree of life (14) and encompass an extremely diverse group of organisms, including
species adapted to forming intimate relationships with plants,
including mutualistic and parasitic associations, as well as saprophytic growth (15–17). To explore the frequency of HGT between distinct eukaryotic groups that form parasitic associations
with plants, we previously used the predicted protein-encoding
sequences from the genome of a fungal plant parasite, Magnaporthe oryzae (18), as a BLASTp search seed and identiﬁed four
HGTs from fungi to oomycetes with strong phylogenetic support
(19). The oomycetes are distant relatives of fungi and branch
within the stramenopile radiation, which includes a diversity of
photosynthetic microbes possessing plastid organelles of secondary endosymbiotic ancestry (20). Oomycetes, however, are
not photosynthetic and display ﬁlamentous growth, closely resembling fungi in many aspects of their biology. Both fungi and
oomycetes, for instance, feed exclusively by osmotrophy, secreting depolymerizing enzymes to break down complex biological
materials in the extracellular environment, followed by transport
of broken-down metabolic units into the cell. Fungi and oomycetes also cause many of the world’s most serious plant diseases.

ramorum, for example, whereas the Irish potato famine of the
19th century was caused by the late blight parasite Phytophthora
infestans. Important crop diseases caused by fungi include the
devastating rice blast disease caused by M. oryzae and the rusts,
smuts, and mildews that affect wheat, barley, and maize. In this
study we report that HGT between fungi and oomycetes has
occurred to a far greater degree than hitherto recognized (19).
Our previous analysis suggested four strongly supported cases of
HGT, but by using a whole-genome, gene-by-gene phylogenetic
analysis we now reveal a pattern of 34 transfers and propose that
these transfers have been fundamental to the evolution of plant
parasitic traits within the oomycetes.
Results and Discussion
Identifying and Testing the Pattern of HGT Between Fungi and
Oomycetes. Among the best methods for identifying HGT is to

identify a gene phylogeny that places a taxonomic group (recipient) within the branches of a distantly related group (donor)
in direct contradiction to the known phylogenetic relationships
of the respective taxa (2, 6). To identify all potential gene transfers between fungi and oomycetes, we selected the predicted
proteomes of the oomycete species Phytophthora ramorum, Phytophthora sojae, Phytophthora infestans, and Hyaloperonospora
parasitica (also named Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis) (21–23).
We processed each proteome separately, ﬁrst excluding all putative transposable elements (SI Materials and Methods). Then
we clustered the genes from each genome into closely related
cluster groups (24) (SI Materials and Methods). Cluster groups
that BLASTp demonstrated were exclusively found only in the
oomycete genomes were then removed (SI Materials and Methods). This process left 3,014, 3,018, 3,233, and 2,169 cluster groups
from P. ramorum, P. sojae, P. infestans, and H. parasitica, respectively, totaling 11,434 gene clusters (Table 1). We then used
a gene-by-gene phylogeny pipeline (7) to generate fast maximumlikelihood trees for all 11,434 gene family groups, using a database of 795 (173 eukaryotic and 622 prokaryotic) genomes (Table
S1). These data were searched manually for trees that demonstrated putative fungi/oomycete gene transfer. Gene families that
produced unresolved tree topologies were reprocessed by running
the tree-building pipeline again but using different gathering
thresholds (SI Materials and Methods).

All of the predicted fungi/oomycete HGTs were subject to
reevaluation of taxon sampling using additional database searches
and manual alignment improvement, followed by recalculation of
the phylogenetic tree, combined with bootstrap analyses (see SI
Materials and Methods and Table S2 for details of phylogenetic
analysis). These analyses identiﬁed multiple cases in which
oomycete genes (the recipient group) branched within a clade of
fungal genes (the donor group) and a single case demonstrating
the opposite relationship. To conﬁrm the results of these phylogenetic analyses, we used alternative topology tests to test
whether it was possible to reject monophyly of the donor group.
Where taxon sampling allowed, we used a variety of different
topology constraints, corresponding to different relationships
within the fungi (15, 25). This approach enabled us to partially
polarize the ancestry of the HGT event relative to the donor
group (Table S3). Taken together, our analyses identiﬁed 20 gene
families predicted to have been transferred from within the fungi
to the oomycetes and one case in which the transfer occurred
from the oomycetes to the fungi (Fig. 1 and Figs. S1.1–S1.21).
Our pipeline analysis also identiﬁed four gene families that
were exclusively found in oomycete and fungal genomes and
not present in any additional taxonomic groups analyzed. We
checked to conﬁrm that the taxon sampling was robust by comparison with the GenBank nr database, using both BLASTp and
psi-BLAST with ﬁve iterations (26), and by interrogating the
GenBank EST and the Taxonomically Broad EST database using tBLASTn (27). Because of the taxon distribution it was not
possible to perform phylogenetic analysis to test an HGT hypothesis directly, because the taxon sampling included only
oomycetes and fungi. However, punctate taxon distribution of

a gene family can be used to suggest HGT because alternative
explanations involving ancient acquisition of a gene in the last
common ancestor, coupled to gene loss, are less parsimonious
(see ref. 6 for description of different HGT scenarios). On the
basis of these criteria, we have included the additional four gene
families among the putative fungi–oomycete HGTs (Table 2 and
Table S3).
Our analysis also identiﬁed an additional nine gene families
that demonstrated phylogenetic support for the oomycete gene
branching within the fungi to the exclusion of all other taxa,
but the approximately unbiased (AU) alternative topology tests
proved inconclusive, suggesting that the case for HGT is not deﬁnitive given available data (Table S3). In four of these cases
(Figs. S1.22–S1.24 and S1.30) our analyses demonstrated that the
gene family was present in a mosaic scattering of prokaryote,
fungi, and oomycete taxa, with the oomycetes branching within
the fungal clade but with weak bootstrap support. These data sets
implicate HGT (on the basis of taxonomic distribution of the gene
family with phylogenetic analyses suggesting fungi-to-oomycete
HGT), but alternative topology tests proved inconclusive. The
remaining ﬁve gene families also suggested fungi-to-oomycete
HGT, placing the oomycete gene within the fungi, separate from
other eukaryotic taxa, with moderate to strong bootstrap support
but with alternative topology tests again proving inconclusive
(Figs. S1.25–S1.29 and Table S3). We therefore ﬁnd strong evidence for 21 gene transfers and tentative evidence for a further
13 transfers, suggesting an important and pervasive pattern of
HGT between these distantly related groups (Table S3).
Theoretically, the presence of conserved introns in both recipient and donor taxa would suggest that any HGT is the

Fig. 1. Pattern of HGTs between fungi and oomycetes, demonstrating that the majority of the fungal-derived gene transfers are into/or retained by
the plant parasitic oomycetes. Using the results of
the phylogenetic analysis in combination with alternative topology tests, it was possible to estimate
the earliest point of transfer for each of the 21
strongly supported HGTs (Table S3). By comparing
the taxonomic distribution of the HGTs it was then
possible to identify the putative primary point of
acquisition. Incomplete phylogenetic resolution and
incomplete taxon sampling may cause these estimates to misplace the HGT events. We also note that
the ﬁgure is a based on a hypothetical cladogram
and does not identify the pattern of transfer relative
to either phylogenetic distance or time. Additional
genome sampling will enable improved resolution
of these transfers. The number labels on each
transfer event refer to phylogenetic data in Figs.
S1.1–S1.21. Major events in cell evolution are
marked to polarize HGTs in relation to evolutionary
history of these microbes.

product of a direct eukaryotic-to-eukaryotic transfer. To test for
evidence of such a pattern, we searched all 30 HGT gene families
supported by phylogenetic analysis (Figs. S1.1–S1.30) for evidence of a conserved intron present in the donor and recipient
taxa. We found eight such cases (Table 2 and Table S4), providing additional data to support the hypothesis that in these
cases the transfers are eukaryotic-to-eukaryotic HGT events.
Distribution of HGTs Relative to Evolution of Parasitic Traits in the
Oomycetes. To provide additional data for polarizing the ancestry

of these HGT events, we sequenced the genome of Hyphochytrium
catenoides using a combination of DNA and RNA (transcribed as
cDNA) sequencing using both the Roche 454 GS FLX titanium
and Illumina GAIIx paired-end methods (SI Materials and Methods). H. catenoides forms a sister branch to the oomycetes and, like
the oomycetes, was originally classiﬁed as a fungus because of its
fungal-like morphology and osmotrophic feeding habit (20, 28).
However, molecular phylogenetics have since demonstrated that
oomycetes and hyphochytriomycetes are sister groups and branch
separately from fungi within the stramenopile radiation (20, 28).
Analysis of this draft genome assembly revealed that all of the 34
oomycete/fungi HGTs are absent from the Hyphochytrium genome
(SI Materials and Methods). Of the 34 putative HGTs identiﬁed,
we noted that only 2 were present in the genome assembly of the
oomycete ﬁsh parasite Saprolegnia parasitica (Figs. S1.1 and S1.21),
one of which is an HGT from the oomycete lineage to the fungi
(Fig. 1). To further test this pattern we compared the 34 HGTs
with 13,807 proteins from the oomycete Albugo laibachii genome
available in GenBank (29). Albugo forms a deeper branch sister
to the Phytophthora/Hyaloperonospora clade and possesses a distinct repertoire of effector proteins compared with other
oomycete plant pathogens (29). Comparative analysis suggests
that only one of the HGTs was present in the Albugo assembly
(HGT 34; Table 2 and Table S3). However, all 34 HGTs were
present in one or more of the Phytophthora/Hyaloperonospora
plant parasitic oomycete species. The majority of the HGTs
therefore seem to have been acquired speciﬁcally within the
oomycete plant parasite clade, although this result will need
retesting as more oomycete genomes become available.
In 2006 Richards et al. (19) provided preliminary evidence of
a pattern of HGT between fungi and oomycetes. These data were
based on a BLAST survey of a single fungal genome and provided
strong evidence for four gene transfers from fungi to oomycetes,
with an additional four candidates for which the tree topologies
could not be resolved but could potentially indicate HGT. We
used these data to propose that HGT led to transfer of osmo4 of 6 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1105100108

trophic characteristics from fungi to oomycetes and was an important step in the evolution of the fungal-like biology of
oomycetes and possibly their sisters (e.g., hyphochytridiomycetes),
which together form the “Pseudofungi” (20). The data reported
here were based on a comprehensive gene-by-gene phylogeny
approach and conﬁrmed ﬁve of these HGTs [including the four
strongly supported HGTs reported previously (19); Table 2 and
Table S5]. The remaining three HGTs, which were listed as tentative in the 2006 article, are not supported by this analysis (Table
S5). Using additional genome sampling including a de novo assembly of H. cateniodes, we were then able to test the hypothesis
that fungal-to-oomycete HGTs were important for the transition
from a phagotrophic algal form to an osmotrophic ﬁlamentous
form deep within the oomycete/hyphochytrium clade. Contrary to
our previous suggestion (19), the results of this study support an
alternative hypothesis, with the pattern of HGT seeming to have
occurred much later, with the majority of the HGTs speciﬁcally
retained by oomycete plant parasites, a pattern consistent with the
putative function of these proteins, discussed below (Fig. 2, Table
2, and Table S5). Furthermore, the pattern demonstrates that the
HGTs occurred after the last common ancestor of the oomycetes
and the hyphochytriomycetes had lost the capacity for phagotrophy and had instead evolved an osmotrophic/ﬁlamentous lifestyle (Fig. 1), demonstrating that the absence of phagotrophy, at
least for the oomycetes, is not a barrier to HGT.
The pattern of fungal-derived HGTs implicates the gene
acquisitions as being important in the evolution of plant parasitism. To test this idea, we examined the HGTs in detail. First,
we found that of the 34 HGTs, 21 demonstrated evidence of
gene duplication after transfer. In some cases the number of
gene duplication events was extensive, such that the 33 fungito-oomycete HGTs contributed a total of 329 predicted genes,
including 143 genes to P. ramorum, 117 to P. sojae, 48 to
P. infestans, and 21 to H. parasitica (Table 1).
Putative Function of HGTs in the Oomycetes. We set out to determine the proportion of the HGT candidates that were predicted to encode secreted proteins (SI Materials and Methods).
Both fungi and oomycetes secrete large numbers of proteins,
including plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, attachment factors,
and effector proteins to subvert host defenses. We used a combination of SignalP and WolfPSORT to identify HGT-derived
genes that putatively encoded proteins with N-terminal secretion
signals (Table S5). This analysis showed that between 62% and
76% of all the HGT-derived genes in each of the four oomycete
genomes investigated possess putative N-terminal secretion sigRichards et al.

tively degrade plant-speciﬁc structural components, including
lignin, hemicellulose, pectin, and suberin. These structural
compounds include key components of plant cell walls (e.g.,
hemicellulose and pectin) and the waxy epidermis (cutin), which
together constitute the ﬁrst barrier to plant infection (Fig. 2).
Consequently, any acquisition of enzymes used to break down
these structures would be advantageous to a plant parasite.
Additional HGTs include several gene products predicted to
be involved in nutrient acquisition including a nucleotide transporter, which putatively functions in purine and/or pyrimidine
uptake (Table S5). Potentially coupled to this adaptation, the
fungal-derived HGTs include a putative xanthine dioxygenase
involved in hydroxylation of the purine xanthine to uric acid (30,
31) (Fig. 2). A putative monosaccharide transporter gene was
identiﬁed that would enable the cell to trafﬁc sugar monomers
(Fig. 2), whereas two additional fungal-derived HGT acquisitions
were also identiﬁed that putatively function to process monosaccharides within the cell (Fig. 2). A nitrilase is present among
the putative HGTs, predicted to break down toxic nitriles to
carboxylic acids and ammonia. Such enzymes in plant parasites
have been shown to break down the plant defense compound
hydrogen cyanide into formamide (32). The list of fungal-derived
EVOLUTION

nals (Table 1). This is particularly striking in P. ramorum and P.
sojae, where 71% and 76% of the HGT-derived genes putatively
possess N-terminal signal peptides, respectively. The fungal-derived HGTs therefore account for between 2.7% (P. infestans)
and 7.6% (P. ramorum) of the total predicted secretome of these
plant parasites (Table 1).
To investigate the putative function of all 34 HGT gene
families, we used a combination of BLAST and PFAM HMM
homology searches to annotate these genes (Table 2, SI Materials
and Methods, and Table S5). Strikingly, 13 of the 32 HGT gene
families that could be annotated are predicted to function in the
breakdown, transport, or remodeling of sugars (Fig. 2, Table 2,
and Table S5). Indeed, a total of nine fungal-derived HGT gene
families were predicted to encode extracellular polysaccharide
depolymerizing enzymes and therefore putatively to break down
rutin, hemicellulose, or pectin polysaccharides (Fig. 2, Table 2,

fungi-to-oomycete HGTs also includes four esterase/lipaseencoding genes, three of which are predicted to be secreted, and
a further three enzymes that are putatively involved in the degradation of complex aromatic polymers (Fig. 2, Table 2, and

Fig. 2. Schematic diagram demonstrating the oomycete functional proteome derived from fungi by HGT and its putative function regarding host attack. The
majority of functions are related to attacking and/or feeding on plant cell tissue. HGTs were represented on the ﬁgure when it was possible to identify
a putative function (these are illustrated in numbered gray oblongs, with the numbers referring to the 34 HGTs identiﬁed; Table 2 and Table S5), with strongly
supported HGTs conﬁrmed by alternative topology tests) enclosed within a black line (Figs. S1.1–S1.21). Oblongs with additional red borders represent genes
shown to be up-regulated in P. infestans microarray data (22) after 5 d infection of plant tissue (Table S5).

HGTs also encompasses a putative histidine phosphatase domain protein, which putatively functions in breakdown of phytic
acid and other organophosphate substrates (33). Phytic acid is
the primary storage form of phosphate and inositol in plants
(34). Consequently, this acquisition might provide an adaptation
for uptake of phosphates from plant tissue.
Finally, the list of HGTs includes two proteins that in fungi
have been directly implicated in plant parasitism. The LysM
domain-containing gene family acquired by HGT from fungi has,
for instance, been shown in fungal plant parasites to be linked
with suppression of plant defenses. In Cladosporium fulvum, the
causal agent of leaf mold of tomato, implicated in suppression of
chitin-triggered plant immunity (35). Second, there is an example
of a necrosis-inducing protein or (Nep1)-like protein (NLP) that
is a candidate fungi-to-oomycete HGT (36). Inﬁltration of NPP1
protein into leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana results in transcript
accumulation of plant defense-related genes, production of reactive oxygen species and ethylene, callose apposition, and localized cell death (36).
Conclusion
When considered together, our analysis demonstrates a pattern of
at least 21 HGTs, and probably more than 34, between fungi and
oomycetes, with the vast majority of predicted HGTs (33 in total)
transferring gene functions from fungi to oomycetes. This equates
to a small proportion of the total genome for which phylogenetic
analysis was possible (0.5–1% of the genome analyzed; Table 1), but
in many cases these gene transfers have subsequently undergone
numerous gene duplications. A large fraction of the HGT-derived
proteins are predicted to be secreted (Table 1), strongly suggesting
that HGT from fungi has played a signiﬁcant role in the evolution of

the oomycete secretome. The observed pattern of transfer may
have facilitated, or aided, the spread of oomycetes to plant hosts
and their evolution into successful plant parasites. Comparative
genomics demonstrates that these transfers do not seem to date
back to the initial transition to an osmotrophic lifestyle (19) because
they are, in the majority, absent in the animal parasitic oomycete
Saprolegnia and the free-living ﬁlamentous osmotrophic Hyphochytrium. This suggests that osmotrophy, and the capacity to grow as
strand-like hyphal cells, probably arose before diversiﬁcation of
these lineages and before the acquisition of fungal genes by HGT.
Interestingly, fungal-derived HGTs may, however, represent speciﬁc acquisitions to life as a plant parasite. Our conclusion is consistent with the predicted functions of the HGT candidates aiding
entry to plant cells, allowing efﬁcient nutrient acquisition and
leading to microbial proliferation in plant tissue.
Materials and Methods
Detailed descriptions of whole-genome gene-by-gene phylogenetic analysis,
alternative topology tests, H. catenoides DNA and RNA preparation and
sequencing, gene annotation, and identiﬁcation of secreted proteins are
provided in SI Materials and Methods. All potential HGTs found in a single
oomycete genome were treated as possible cases of contamination. To test
these, we conducted phylogeny of linked genes on DNA contigs. In all cases,
we could conﬁrm that the HGT was present within the oomycete genome
(Table S6). An example of each HGT oomycete gene family is included as
a combined FASTA ﬁle in Dataset S1.
